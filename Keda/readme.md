# Build docker image and test it

* Because we do not need HTTPS in this scenario and enabling it for `docker run` is a bit difficult (more [here](https://medium.com/@woeterman_94/docker-in-visual-studio-unable-to-configure-https-endpoint-f95727187f5f)) I decided to disable HTTPS. If HTTPS is not disable during container running the exception is thrown:

  ```
  PS D:\GitHub\kicaj29\Kubernetes\Keda\FancyMicroservice\FancyMicroservice> docker run -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+:443;http://+:80" -p 4031:443 -p 4032:80 kicaj29/fancymicroservice:v1
  Unhandled exception. System.InvalidOperationException: Unable to configure HTTPS endpoint. No server certificate was specified, and the default developer certificate could not be found or is out of date.
  To generate a developer certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https'. To trust the certificate (Windows and macOS only) run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust'.
  For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.ListenOptionsHttpsExtensions.UseHttps(ListenOptions listenOptions, Action`1 configureOptions)
  ```
* To disable HTTPS
  * Change `launchSettings.json` `"useSSL": false`
  * In `Program.cs` comment out `app.UseHttpsRedirection();`

* Build the image
`PS D:\GitHub\kicaj29\Kubernetes\Keda\FancyMicroservice\FancyMicroservice> docker build -f Dockerfile -t kicaj29/fancymicroservice:v1 ..`
More about building docker images using dockerfile created by VS can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/container-build?view=vs-2022#docker-build) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72718492/cannot-run-docker-build-when-using-docker-setup-from-visual-studio).

* Check if the image is on the list

```
PS D:\GitHub\kicaj29\Kubernetes\Keda\FancyMicroservice\FancyMicroservice> docker images kicaj29/fancymicroservice
REPOSITORY                  TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
kicaj29/fancymicroservice   v1        0f0ce5e57ce5   26 minutes ago   212MB
```

* Run the image

Set environment variable `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` on `Development` to enable swagger page.
